### Hello! I'm Ishani :relaxed:

___

#### I'm a public sector Data Scientist obssessed with Data Visualisation.

In this space, I will be posting up my journey in Data Visualisation as a Data Scientist. I want to put all my musings up, to experiment with the most efficient ways to communicate to non-technical audiences using data. And also to challenge myself because that's fun too :sunny:

#### Without further ado, here are my list of musings:
- :speech_balloon: Microsoft visuals beat Python and R visuals (when communicating to business stakeholders)
- :grey_question: More to come . . .

___
--- Stay tuned for more of my DataViz experiments!
